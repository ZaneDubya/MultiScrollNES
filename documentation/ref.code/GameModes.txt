Main
ChooseMode
    A. See WorldMode.txt
		
	B. LoadMap
		Loads initial map data. Shares code with MapUpdate for loading rows/columns of tiles, and new cells.
		
	C. Conversation
		Allows the player to engage in (doubtless enthralling) conversations with Actors.
		Contains functionality for scripting, checking flags, if you have an object, and so on.
		
	D. TextEngine
		Already coded, except for placing text in the world (although this was in previous revs and should be recoverable).
		
	E. MenuEngine
		Working with TextEngine, allows the display of menus in either full screen or partial screen representations.
		The current menu set up is controlled by an index offset by selected, which can be stacked four deep.
		Loading a Menu is easy: Set the menu index, set the offset, and call MenuLoad. The MenuData itself contains information
		as to what to display and where to display it.
