S = superchunk
C = chunk
x = x offset in chunk

We load 4x4 chunks into memory - the offset into this array of chunks is:

x:	lda hi_x			; x = hi << 1 + (lo << 1)
	rol
	tax
	lda lo_x
	rol
	txa
	bcc +
	ora #$01
*	and #$03
	sta temp
	lda hi_y			; y = hi << 1 + (lo << 1)
	rol
	tax
	lda lo_y
	rol
	txa
	bcc +
	ora #$01
*	and #$03
	asl
	asl
	and temp			; a = (y << 2) & x
