The game is divided into modes. Only one mode can be active at any time.

=== Initializing a Mode ===
When a mode is first called, GameMode will be set.

=== Changing Modees ===
To change modes, the current mode should first save whatever state is necessary, then 
set GameMode to the index of the new mode, and GameModeState to $00. Then the mode should
turn off the PPU display. On the next frame update, the kernel will pass control to the new mode.

Each mode is entirely responsible for initializing, updating, and saving its own state.

    X_Frame     Called when the mode is initialized. Responsible for getting the proper initialization state,
                setting all variables (including cleaning up variables as required), loading music and graphics,
                and ending if necessary.
    X_Update    Called once a frame when the mode is active. Responsible for managing the mode state, 
                getting input, updating the display, and setting the next mode to enter as necessary.
    X_End       Cleans up as necessary.
