PHANTOM TRANSACTION

Transaction errors are effecting the consistency of data in cyberspace.

The world is in upheaval: the Catalyst, a data opcode which allows a Sprite
to duplicate any data they wish - has altered the balance of power. An evil
Sprite known as the Phantom has arisen, using this power to grab more cycles for
himself.
