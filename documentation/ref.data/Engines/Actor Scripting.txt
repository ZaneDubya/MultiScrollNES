Example script that will cause an actor to walk in a square (67 bytes):
Again:
    lda [ActorActionMove|DirectionEast|Speed1]
    sta Actor_Action,x
    jsr ActorScript_Yield
    lda [ActorActionWait|$f0]
    sta Actor_Action,x
    jsr ActorScript_Yield
    lda [ActorActionMove|DirectionSouth|Speed1]
    sta Actor_Action,x
    jsr ActorScript_Yield
    lda [ActorActionWait|$f0]
    sta Actor_Action,x
    jsr ActorScript_Yield
    lda [ActorActionMove|DirectionWest|Speed1]
    sta Actor_Action,x
    jsr ActorScript_Yield
    lda [ActorActionWait|$f0]
    sta Actor_Action,x
    jsr ActorScript_Yield
    lda [ActorActionMove|DirectionNorth|Speed1]
    sta Actor_Action,x
    jsr ActorScript_Yield
    lda [ActorActionWait|$f0]
    sta Actor_Action,x
    jsr ActorScript_Yield
    jmp Again                                       ; repeat.
    
Making the script more efficient (43 bytes):
Again:
    lda [ActorActionMove|DirectionEast|Speed1]
    jsr ActorScript_SetAction                       ; calls ActorScript_Yield
    lda [ActorActionWait|$f0]
    jsr ActorScript_SetAction
    lda [ActorActionMove|DirectionSouth|Speed1]
    jsr ActorScript_SetAction
    lda [ActorActionWait|$f0]
    jsr ActorScript_SetAction
    lda [ActorActionMove|DirectionWest|Speed1]
    jsr ActorScript_SetAction
    lda [ActorActionWait|$f0]
    jsr ActorScript_SetAction
    lda [ActorActionMove|DirectionNorth|Speed1]
    jsr ActorScript_SetAction
    lda [ActorActionWait|$f0]
    jsr ActorScript_SetAction
    jmp Again                                       ; repeat.
