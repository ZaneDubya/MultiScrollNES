Sprite code:
	At FrameBegin, SpriteZero is placed and SpriteIndex is set to 1.
	The frame code is run and the actors are updated.
	Finally, SpriteUpdate is called, which goes through all the actors
		and places them on screen in this order...
		All Dynamics (pre sorted)
		Statics in TL chunk
		Statics in TR chunk
		STatics in BL chunk
		Statics in BR chunk
	... incrementing SpriteIndex as necessary. After all Sprites are drawn,
		the remainder of Sprites (inc SpriteIndex, while SpriteIndex != 0) are
		set to y = 0.

Sprite data:
	Data starts at B800 for 2048b data, BE00 for 512b data (1011 1110),.
	There are 256 chr ram tiles (16x16 8x8 tiles).
	Metasprites are comprised of 8x8 sprites.

8 or 12 sprites, 4 tiles each, 2 bytes per tile.

Offsets:
The size of the offset determines how much data is allowed for sprite def data.
We currently have an 8 byte offset. 2048 max data, 32 max sprites.
With an 8byte offset, maximum data for sprites is 2048 bytes.
		byte 0: Offset

			metasprite data at address: oooo oHHH LLLL L...
				(oooo = hardcoded offset, not in sprite data)
With a 32byte offset, maximum data for sprites is 8192 bytes.
		byte 0: Offset
			LLLH HHHH
			metasprite data at address: oooH HHHH LLL. ....
