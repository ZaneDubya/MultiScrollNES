Text Engine

Notes:
Max string length is 0xff

To Start:
	Put pointer to text string in x, y and call TextDisplay
	

TextDisplay:
	Sets TextDisplayPtr
	Sets Mode to TextDisplay. (Pauses action.)
	Sets TextDisplayIndex = 0
	exit

Main Calls TextDisplayRoutine
	Checks TextDisplayIndex
	0:
		Build string. Get list of characters to copy.
		Get location where display is going to write in PPU.
		Copy AttributeTable to localcopy.
		Modify AttributeTable (03 -> TileMapPaletteReplacement, all attributes where PPU will be to 00)
		Set up VRAM write
		Set TextDisplayIndex = 1
		Set PendingSwitch = 0
		VBLK: Copy the first 24 text tiles.
	1:
		Build first half of nametable for text.
		Set up VRAM write
		Set Index = 2
		VBLK: Copy the second 24 text tiles.
	2:
		Build second half of nametable for text.
		Set up VRAM write
		Set Index = 3
		VBLK: Copy NameTable from VRAM (224 bytes)
	3:
		Finish nametable and attribute table writing
		VBLK: Copy NameTable data, AttributeTable data, to VRAM
		Set Index = 4
	4:
		Prepare to restore nametable and attributetable to vram. when ready, check for A press
		if A press, set Index = 5
	5:
		Restore control to WorldEngine, which will continue scripting.
		VBLK: Restore nametable and attributetable to vram
		
SO! We need two new routines:
	SelectRoutine for Main
	SelectRoutine for VBLANK
