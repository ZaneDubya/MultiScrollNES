Description of all GameModes and their functions.
Last updated 11/27/2013

Main
ChooseMode
	A. WorldMode - handles all world updating
		1. ActorUpdate - run update routines on all loaded actors.
			Movement
			What else do actors do in the world? Basically pretend to do things.
			* Note: actors can share some common routines (moveto)
		2. EggUpdate? - check all in-range egg conditions.
            Triggering data is saved and compared.
			?GameModeChanged
				Y> Return from WorldMode
		3. Camera update - scroll based on main actor position or camera object.
            These are set by flags. Never scroll past bounds. Check inertia.
		4. Check for scroll trigger
			Y> MapUpdate, loads tiles, new cells if necessary.
		5. Check action buttons <if any, Return from WorldMode>
			?A - CheckActivate (activate object is flagged; if nothing present, no activate noise)
				?> Activate or no-activate-noise.
			?B - LoadInGameMenu OR Nothing
			?Select - Map
			?Start - Menu
		6. Check movement buttons
			?Movement buttons down
				Y> Set move flags on actor.
		
	B. LoadMap
		Loads initial map data. Shares code with MapUpdate for loading rows/columns of tiles, and new cells.
		
	C. Conversation
		Allows the player to engage in (doubtless enthralling) conversations with Actors.
		Contains functionality for scripting, checking flags, if you have an object, and so on.
		
	D. TextEngine
		Already coded, except for placing text in the world (although this was in previous revs and should be recoverable).
		
	E. MenuEngine
		Working with TextEngine, allows the display of menus in either full screen or partial screen representations.
		The current menu set up is controlled by an index offset by selected, which can be stacked four deep.
		Loading a Menu is easy: Set the menu index, set the offset, and call MenuLoad. The MenuData itself contains information
		as to what to display and where to display it.
