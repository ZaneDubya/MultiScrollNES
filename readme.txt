Galezie, a Tactics RPG for the Nintendo Entertainment System
	(C) 2014 Zane Wagner [zanewagner@gmail.com]
	A work in progress.

Can be assembled using Ophis
	http://michaelcmartin.github.io/Ophis/

Requires a NES emulator with Mapper 28 support:
	Nintendulator v0.975 Beta
	http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/nintendulator/nintendulator_bin_unicode.zip

Documentation for the various file formats and engine routines can be found in
the 'reference' folder, but no warranty is made as to the correctness of this
information. I plan to revisit the documentation after the engine is complete.
