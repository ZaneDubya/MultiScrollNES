SCENE: Introduction (1.0 Opening Image)

A furious battle between two forces - blue and red.
Large explosions and effects give a sense of excitement.
Blue guys are cut down left and right - until finally only one remains.
The final Blue is cornered: ????
A terrifying Red sprite with an all-white mask approaches: PHANTOM

????:
Ah, the Phantom. I should have known you would be here. The bitrot gives you away.

PHANTOM:
You have precious few cycles left for humor. But if you give me the Catalyst
you've stolen, I may let you persist a while longer.

????:
You mean that Catalyst that allow you to replicate a single daemon into an army?

PHANTOM:
Yes!

????:
The Catalyst that steal resources from all other programs in Cyberspace?

PHANTOM:
Don't toy with me! Where is it?

????:
...
Never heard of it!

PHANTOM:
You fool. Very well, I will recover them... after you've been blasted to bits!

The PHANTOM lashes out - and the blue sprite explodes, leaving debris behind. A
red sprite rushes up --- examining the remainder of the blue sprite.

RED SPRITE:
The Catalyst... it's not here!

			????: 
			A dying blue guy - grabs at his remaining compatriot.
			"You have to... get the... catalyst... to Alex."
		He reaches the exit point - and zaps away.
		The red guys approach the exit point...
